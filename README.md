# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
This app allows a user to login, and generate a random affirmation or mantra. This app also allows users to create their own mantras and affirmation to appear in the display. This app provides users with positive words for any situation they find themselves in. This app also gives users a chance to write down and display their own personal mantra and aspiration, in order to internalize it.

### Context:
This project was a solo project, where students were given a comp to replicate and instructions to create functionality. Once the basic functionality was created, students chose their own iteration to complete, which added functionality. For this project, the Contributors chose to create a login section, that displayed the user's name on the home page. They also decided to create a "create your own message" section, where users could input their own message, and it was be included in the list of either mantras or affirmations and it would display in the message display area.
Overall, this project took about 10 hours to complete and it was assigned about 2.5 weeks into Mod 1 at Turing.

### Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
One early win was using Flexbox in order to structure and format the layout correctly. This was a challenge since we had not yet formally covered Flexbox. By using some resources sent by classmates, I was able to research the tool and use it in the project.
Another win was figuring out how to correctly reference a checked radio button, in order to display a random message from that radio button's corresponding array. Being able to create that functionality was really satisfying, and it was helpful to recreate it with the 'new message' feature.
